# dsekai

dsekai is an extremely minimal world, intended to run on very old hardware. It is originally targeted to the 8086/8088 CPU with the intention to make it more portable later.

There are also some rough examples of CGA graphics programming in graphics.c, if that's what you're into.

## Compiling

Compiling dsekai for MS-DOS is best achieved with the OpenWatcom compiler (this is what the Makefile uses).
